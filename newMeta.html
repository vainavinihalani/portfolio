 New Meta is a gaming-inspired merchandise brand, and I designed their entire visual identity—including the logo, packaging box, thank-you card, and Instagram insert. The design direction draws heavily from gamer culture and the nostalgia that comes with late-night matches, retro interfaces, and the shared comfort of long gaming sessions. To make the unboxing experience feel familiar and fun, the product packaging is designed like a pizza box—something every gamer instantly relates to as a classic comfort companion. The overall identity blends playful nostalgia with a bold, modern aesthetic, creating a brand experience that feels both personal and distinctly “gamer.”
