    For a college class, we were given a folder of 100 completely random photos and asked to choose one emotion to depict using only those images. I decided to focus on anger, and it was interesting to see how everyday pictures—things that didn’t look emotional at first—could start to express tension and frustration when placed together. I paid attention to small details like colours, sharp lines, and the mood of each image to build a feeling rather than show it literally. The assignment taught me how much emotion can be communicated through subtle visuals, and how meaning can emerge simply from the way images are chosen and arranged.
