  <p class="text-container">For this assignment, I created a zine titled How to Judge a by Its Cover, built around the idea of how quickly we form assumptions about people and their stories. Each section explores a different lens of judgement—loving someone even after a breakup, the vulnerability behind “boy tears,” the silent weight of judgy eyes, the nostalgia of lost childhood, and the desire to rewrite a love story that has already ended. Through these themes, the zine aims to show how complex, emotional, and human every “cover” really is.</p>
